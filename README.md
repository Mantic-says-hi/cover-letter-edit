# Cover Letter Editor
Writing a cover letter, renaming it and saving it is tedious.
This project aimed to quicken the process and make editing a generic cover letter less of a hassle.

Generates a pdf cover letter using a template, interfaced through a GUI to make running the program easier.
Uses Windows System Environment Variable to find the template, load it in and export the new cover letter
while preserving the template.

If you are a recruiter reading this you have probably read a cover letter generated by this program.
